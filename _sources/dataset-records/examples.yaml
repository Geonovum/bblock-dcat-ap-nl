- title: DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 Dataset example showing binding to OGC API record schema.
  content: |-
    This example shows a linked data / turtle file that is typed both as a dcat:dataset
    as well as an ogcapi-records:Record (geojson:Feature). This is to illustrate the combined properties
    and to validate those against the validation rules.

- title: DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 Dataset example encoded in JSON, showing binding to an OGC API record schema.
  content: |-
    This example shows a json file with OGC API Records info as well as DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 info.
    It uses the JSON-LD context to transform JSON into linked data. 
    This is to illustrate the way interoperability can be achieved between OGC API Records and DCAT-AP-NL 3.0.
   
    The JSON-LD and RDF/Turtle examples are transformed from the JSON source file using the JSON-LD context that you
    can find under the 'Semantic Uplift' section of this building block.

  snippets:
    - language: json
      ref: examples/dataset-record.json
