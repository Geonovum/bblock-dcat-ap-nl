## DCAT-AP-NL Dataset bound to OGC API records schema

This building block defines a binding from OGC API Records schema to the DCAT-AP-NL profile.

This profile extends a building block that uses the official JSON-LD context for DCAT bound to the OGC API Records.

It uses the context for a dcat:Dataset as the basis for a Record.

All very much work in progress at the moment, the implementation might still change considerably.
