## DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 bound to OGC API records schema


This building block defines a binding of the DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 profile to OGC API Records.

This profile extends a building block that uses the official JSON-LD context for DCAT bound to the OGC API Records.

It serves as a building block that follows the pattern for a Dataset description including distributions and dataservices.

All very much work in progress at the moment, the implementation might still change considerably.
