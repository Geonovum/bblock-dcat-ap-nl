# - title: DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 Dataset example encoded in JSON, showing binding to an OGC API record schema.
#   content: |-
#     This example shows a json file with OGC API Records info as well as DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 info.
#     It uses the JSON-LD context to transform JSON into linked data. 
#     This is to illustrate the way interoperability can be achieved between OGC API Records and DCAT-AP-NL 3.0.
   
#     The JSON-LD and RDF/Turtle examples are transformed from the JSON source file using the JSON-LD context that you
#     can find under the 'Semantic Uplift' section of this building block.

#   snippets:
#     - language: json
#       ref: examples/dataset-record.json
#       base-uri: "http://example.com/records/"

    An example based on the BAG metadata record from the NGR. 
    Converted in JSON so the Semantic uplift via a JSON-LD context can be shown.
    
    One of the reasons this does not validate is because it has multi lingual keywords...
