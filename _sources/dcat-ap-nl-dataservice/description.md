## DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 - Dataservice

These building blocks provide a framework to test compatibility of the DCAT-AP-NL 3.0 profile with DCAT-AP, and to make this relationship transparent to any implementation of DCAT-AP-NL using OGC standards.


Implementation is still experimental and might change at any moment. For example the shacl validation of the DatasetSeries example is failing at the moment, which is a known thing.
